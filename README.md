Using the draw.io site or a flowcharting tool of your choice, create a flowchart that models a complete Java program called StringSlicer that uses methods to:

<ol>

 <li>Get a String from the user at the command line</li>

 <li>Populate an ArrayList of Character data (the wrapper class), with each char in the String represented as a separate Character element in the ArrayList</li>

 <li>Output each Character to the command line, each on a separate line.</li>

</ol>

The flowchart should be sufficiently detailed and follow the standards weâ€™ve showcased in our course.
